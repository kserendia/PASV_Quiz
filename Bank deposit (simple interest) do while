The depositor deposited $ 1,000 in the bank. Every year this amount increases by p (p> 0) percent of the initial deposit amount. 
In how many years will the account be $ 1,500?

Write a function called bankPercent that takes p (bank interest) and calculates how many years from now there will be $ 1,500 in the account.

Use a do while loop in your solution.

Examples:

bankPercent (10) must return 5;
bankPercent (5) should return 10;
bankPercent (13) should return 4.


Solution:

function bankPercent(p){
  let years = 0;
  let sum = 1000;
  let int = sum * p / 100;
  do {
     sum += int;
     years++;
  } while (sum < 1500);
  return years;
}
