Having started training, the athlete ran n km on the first day of training. 
Each subsequent day, he increased the rate by 10% from the rate of the previous day. 
Determine how many kilometers the athlete will run on the 10th day of training.

Round the result to the nearest integer using Math.round ().

Write a function called running that takes n (kilometers in 1 day) and returns kilometers on the 10th day of class.

Use a do while loop in your solution.

Examples:

running (1) should return 2;
running (5) should return 12;
running (10) should return 24.


Solution:

function running(n){
  let days = 1;
  let run = n;
  do {
    run += run * 0.1;
    days++;
  } while (days < 10); 
  return Math.round(run);
}
