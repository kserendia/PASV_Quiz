The depositor put some money in the bank. This amount increases annually by percent (percent> 0) percent of the current deposit amount. 
Determine how much money will be on the account after a period of years?

Write a function called bankPercent that takes three numbers as arguments:

money (initial deposit amount);
percent (capitalized bank interest);
period (number of years),
and returns the amount of money on the deposit after a period of years. Round the result to two decimal places.

With this type of deposits, the amount increases annually by p percent of the available (current) amount:

Use a do while loop in your solution.

Examples:

bankPercent (1000, 10, 1) should return "1100.00".
bankPercent (1000, 10, 2) should return "1210.00".
bankPercent (1000, 10, 3) should return "1331.00".
bankPercent (1000, 10, 5) should return "1610.51".

Solution:

function bankPercent(money, percent, period){
  let sum = money;
  let year = 0;
  do {
     sum += sum * percent / 100;
     year++;
  } while (year < period);
  return sum.toFixed (2); 
}
