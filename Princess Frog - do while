The frog princess eats 3 more mosquitoes daily than on the previous day. 
Determine on which day the number of mosquitoes eaten will exceed 1000 if n mosquitoes were eaten on the first day.

Write a function called frogPrincess that takes n (the number of mosquitoes on the first day) and returns the number of days that a frog will eat 1000 mosquitoes.

Use a do while loop in your solution.

Examples:

frogPrincess (1) should return 26;
frogPrincess (12) should return 23;
frogPrincess (99) should return 10.
frogPrincess (100) should return 9.
frogPrincess (1000) should return 1.


Solution:

function frogPrincess(n){
let days = 0;
let sum = 0;
 do {
   sum += n;
   n += 3;
   days++;
 } while (sum <= 1000);
 return days;
}
