You are given two numbers n and m. Find the sum of all integers between n and m, inclusive.

Write a function called sumFromNToM that takes two numbers n, m and returns the sums of the numbers n through m. In the solution, the loop for.

Examples:

the sumFromNToM (5, 5) function should return 5;
the sumFromNToM (5, 2) function must return 0;
sumFromNToM (12, 13) should return 25;
sumFromNToM (5, 7) should return 18.


Solution:

function sumFromNToM(n, m){
  let sum = 0;                       
  for (let i = n; i <= m; i++){
  sum = sum + i;
  }
  return sum;
}
