Write a function named fillArray that takes n (n> = 2) as an argument and returns an array of even numbers from 2 to n, excluding multiples of 3.

You must use the continue statement in your solution.

Examples:

fillArray (10) should return [2, 4, 8, 10]; // even numbers from 2 to 10, except for 6 (6 is a multiple of 3).
fillArray (20) should return [2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20]; // even numbers from 2 to 20, excluding numbers 6, 12, 18 (multiples of 3).
fillArray (7) should return [2, 4]; // even numbers from 2 to 7, excluding 6.
fillArray (3) should return [2]; // even numbers from 1 to 3, excluding 3.
fillArray (2) should return [2].


Solution:

function fillArray(n){
  let arr = [];
   for (let i = 2; i <= n; i+=2) {
     if (i % 3 === 0) {
      continue;
     }
    arr.push(i);
   } 
  return arr;
}
