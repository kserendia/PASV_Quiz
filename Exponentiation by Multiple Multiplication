Without using the exponentiation operation, raise the number a to the power n.

Write a function named power that takes the numbers a and n as arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n (a and n are non-negative integers). 
Use a for loop in your solution. You cannot use the exponentiation operation and methods of the Math object in this exercise.

Examples:

the power (3, 3) function should return 27;
the power (3, 0) function must return 1;
function power (0, 0) must return 1;
power (2, 5) should return 32.


Solution:

function power(a, n){
let pow = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    pow = pow * a;
  }
  return pow;
}
