You are given four numbers - the areas of four squares. Find the side of the smallest square.

Write a minSquareSide function that takes four numbers a, b, c, d (areas of four squares) as arguments and returns the side of the least square.

Example:

minSquareSide (9, 4, 16, 81) should return 2 (minimum square area = 4, side = 2).

Solution:

function minSquareSide(a, b, c, d){
  return Math.min(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(b), Math.sqrt(c), Math.sqrt(d));
}
