Fibonacci numbers are a sequence in which the first two numbers are equal to 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is 
equal to the sum of the two previous numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...

Write a function called fibonacciNumbers that takes n (n> = 2) as an argument and returns an array of n Fibonacci numbers.

Examples:

fibonacciNumbers (2) should return [0, 1];
fibonacciNumbers (5) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3];
fibonacciNumbers (7) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].


Solution:

function fibonacciNumbers(n){
 let arr = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++){
    arr.push(arr[i - 2] + arr[i -1])
  }
 return arr;
}
