Given a number n> 0. Find the sum: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1 / n

Write a function called sumOfFractionals that takes the number n and returns the sum of the fractions with 1 in the numerator and 1 through n in the denominator. 
Use a for loop in your solution. Round the sum to two decimal places.

Examples:

the sumOfFractionals (1) function must return 1;
sumOfFractionals (5) should return 2.28;
sumOfFractionals (10) should return 2.93.


Solution:

function sumOfFractionals(n){
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
  sum = sum + 1 / i;
  }
  return +sum.toFixed(2);
}
