You are given a positive integer n. Find the factorial of n (n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n)

Write a function called factorial that takes n as an argument and returns the factorial of n, i.e. product of numbers from 1 to n.
Examples:

factorial (2) must return 2;
factorial (3) should return 6;
factorial (8) should return 40320.

Solution:

function factorial(n){
  let f = 1;
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
      f = f * i;
  }
  return f;
}
