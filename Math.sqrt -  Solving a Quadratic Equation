The values  of the coefficients of the quadratic equation a, b, c are given. Find the roots of the equation, or return the message "There are no roots".

sqEquation

Recall that to find the roots of a quadratic equation, you need to find the discriminant by the formula:

d.

If D <0, the equation has no roots. Otherwise, the roots of the equation can be found by the formulas:

roots

Write a function called quadraticEquation that takes the values ​​of the variables a, b, c as arguments and returns the
roots of the equation as an array [x1, x2], or the message "There are no roots".

Examples:

quadraticEquation (1, 2, 1) should return [-1, -1];
quadraticEquation (5, 6, 1) should return [-0.2, -1];
the quadraticEquation (1, 1, 1) function should return "There are no roots".

Solution:
function quadraticEquation(a, b, c){
  let D = Math.pow(b, 2) - (4 * a * c);
  if (D < 0) return "There are no roots";
  let x1 = ((-b + Math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a));
  let x2 = ((-b - Math.sqrt(D)) / (2 * a));
  return [x1, x2];
}
