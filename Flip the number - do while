A positive integer is given. Get another integer obtained from the original number by reading it from right to left. 
Use operations of multiplication, division and finding the remainder from division. 
The use of string and array methods is prohibited. Use a do while loop in your solution.

Write a function named invertNumber that takes n as an argument and returns the inverted number.

If, as a result of flipping the number, the first digit becomes the digit 0, the number should be displayed without leading zero.

Examples:

invertNumber (123) should return 321.
invertNumber (15670) should return 7651.
invertNumber (11) should return 11.
invertNumber (1000) should return 1.


Solution:
function invertNumber(n){
  let res = 0;
  let lastn;
  do {
     lastn = n % 10;
     res = res * 10 + lastn;
     n = (n - lastn) / 10;
  } while (n > 0);
  return res;
}
