The student does not know a single English word at the beginning of the training. 
On the first day of class, he learned 5 English words. 
On each subsequent day, he learned 2 more words than on the previous one. How many days will the student know at least n English words?

Write a function called englishWords that takes a non-negative number n (n> = 0) (the number of English words the student wants to learn) as an argument 
and returns the number of days it takes to learn n words.

Examples:

englishWords (5) must return 1; // 5 words a student can learn in 1 day.
englishWords (10) should return 2; // a student can learn 10 words in 2 days (5 + 7 = 12)
function englishWords (20) should return 3. // 20 words a student can learn in 3 days (5 + 7 + 9 = 21)
function englishWords (30) should return 4. // 30 words a student can learn in 4 days (5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 32)


Solution:

function englishWords(n){
  let learnedDaily = 5;
  let learnedSum = 5;
  let days = 1;
  while (n > learnedSum){
    learnedDaily = learnedDaily + 2;
    days++;
    learnedSum = learnedSum + learnedDaily;
  }
  return days;
}
